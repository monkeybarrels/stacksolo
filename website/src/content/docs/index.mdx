<div class="intro">

Solo developers are forced to become their own DevOps team. Terraform, IAM, networking, load balancers, CI/CD. The pressure builds. StackSolo gives you structure to operate at depth without losing control.

## One config. One command. Deployed.

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "gcpProjectId": "my-gcp-project",
    "networks": [{
      "functions": [{ "name": "api" }],
      "uis": [{ "name": "web" }],
      "loadBalancer": {
        "routes": [
          { "path": "/api/*", "backend": "api" },
          { "path": "/*", "backend": "web" }
        ]
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

```bash
stacksolo deploy
```

Cloud Functions, Firebase Hosting, Load Balancer, IAM, networking. All handled.
